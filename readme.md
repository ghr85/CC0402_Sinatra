# Codeclan Week 04 Day 02

## HTTP, Sinatra and Ruby

### Lab/Homework - Paper Rock Scissors game


You are given the premise of a basic paper rock scissors game, using Sinatra you are to build a version of this in Ruby as described in the [brief.md](brief.md).

There are numerous moving parts in this now


## Order of Approach

* Read the instructions
* Read the instructions again...yes. Because how much time will you waste if you misinterpret.
* Create folder layout and headers
* Decide on what logic you'll need, plan classes, attributes, methods, tests
* The controller defines the routes that will be taken upon HTTP method
* Require Sinatra and relevant tools in your controller file
* Create your specs file for testing model logic - remember to cover negative cases
* Create your logic file in model folder - keep your variable names tight
* Test that these work first of all
* Create your view folder
* Layout is your template housing for all other page eventualities
* Create other page eventualities
* Style it up with CSS and polish
